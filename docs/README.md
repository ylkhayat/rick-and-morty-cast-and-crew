# Rick & Morty Cast & Crew

## About This Project

This project is a full-stack application designed to showcase my ability to integrate various technologies into a cohesive and functional system. It demonstrates proficiency in several areas including front-end development with React, state management with React Context, and back-end development with Apollo Server and Prisma.

The application is a character viewer, allowing users to browse, bookmark, and view detailed information about different characters. It uses a GraphQL API to fetch data, and implements user authentication and session management.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by one of the coding interviews I had. I found the task interesting and thought it would be a great idea to share it with the community. If you're curious about the entity that proposed such a task, feel free to ping me. I believe in the power of shared knowledge and I'm happy to contribute to the collective learning of the open source community.

## How to run the project

I took the extra step of shipping a dockerized application and a docker-compose file to run the application. To run the application, you need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

![Sneak Peak](./sneak-peak.png)

Install the applications first by running the following command from the root folder, don't worry it will install things for the monorepo:

```bash
yarn install
```

Do not forget to create the `.env` following the `.env.example` file in the backend folder `packages/backend` and add the corresponding environment variables:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=<hakuna_matata>
```

Afterwards, simply run the following command to start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

and the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` but we need the migrations to be shipped. Thus, proceed with the following command to run the migrations only when the database is completely up and running:

```bash
yarn db:migrate
```
